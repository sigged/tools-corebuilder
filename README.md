# Core Builder

> <br />
> Build dotnet core projects in bulk.

> <br />

This shell script allows bulk compilation of all dotnet core projects found in the nested directory structure, by scanning for .sln files.

## Usage

Copy the command to a folder which has subfolders containing .sln Visual Studio solutions, and execute it.

```
./corebuilder.sh
```

### Windows

Windows users need a Linux Bash Shell installed (for example Windows Subsystem for Linux, Cygwin, Git bash, ...). Currently only tested in git bash.
